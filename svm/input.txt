For example,\nthe database is not connected to automatically since no assumption\nis made regarding whether you intend to use it. This file lets\nyou globally define which systems you would like loaded with every\nrequest.\nInstructions\nThese are the things you can load automatically:\n1. Packages\n2. Libraries\n3. Drivers\n4. Helper files\n5. Custom config files\n6. Language files\n7. Models	Notice

The default setting of 'REQUEST_URI' works for most servers.\nIf your links do not seem to work, try one of the other delicious flavors:\n'REQUEST_URI' Uses $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']\n'QUERY_STRING' Uses $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']\n'PATH_INFO' Uses $_SERVER['PATH_INFO']\nWARNING: If you set this to 'PATH_INFO', URIs will always be URL-decoded!	Notice

The defaults are fine on servers with proper\nsecurity, but you may wish (or even need) to change the values in\ncertain environments (Apache running a separate process for each\nuser, PHP under CGI with Apache suEXEC, etc.).

By default there is only one group (the 'default' group).\nThe $query_builder variables lets you determine whether or not to load\nthe query builder class.	Notice

EN	php	symfony	src/Symfony/Component/ExpressionLanguage/Parser.php	symfony/src/Symfony/Component/ExpressionLanguage/Parser.php/314	Operators like "not" and "matches" are valid method or property names,\n\nIn other words, besides NAME_TYPE, OPERATOR_TYPE could also be parsed as a property or method.\nThis is because operators are processed by the lexer prior to names. So "not" in "foo.not()" or "matches" in "foo.matches" will be recognized as an operator first.\nBut in fact, "not" and "matches" in such expressions shall be parsed as method or property names.\n\nAnd this ONLY works if the operator consists of valid characters for a property or method name.\n\nOther types, such as STRING_TYPE and NUMBER_TYPE, can't be parsed as property nor method names.\n\nAs a result, if $token is NOT an operator OR $token->value is NOT a valid property or method name, an exception shall be thrown.

PHPs auto-save at script end via\nsession_register_shutdown is executed after fastcgi_finish_request. So in this case\nthe data could be missing the next request because it might not be saved the moment\nthe new request is processed.\nA locking save handler (e.g. the native 'files') circumvents concurrency problems like\nthe one above. But by saving the session before long-running things in the terminate event,\nwe ensure the session is not blocked longer than needed.\nWhen regenerating the session ID no locking is involved in PHPs session design. See\nhttps://bugs.php.net/61470 for a discussion. So in this case, the session must\nbe saved anyway before sending the headers with the new session ID. Otherwise session\ndata could get lost again for concurrent requests with the new ID. One result could be\nthat you get logged out after just logging in.\n\nThis listener should be executed as one of the last listeners, so that previous listeners\ncan still operate on the open session. This prevents the overhead of restarting it.\nListeners after closing the session can still work with the session as usual because\nSymfonys session implementation starts the session on demand. So writing to it after\nit is saved will just restart it.	Notice
